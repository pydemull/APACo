## Overview of the repository
The aim of this repository is to allow the reproduction of the analytical pipeline implemented to get the results of the APA&Co project ([ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04732923](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04732923?term=APA%26Co&rank=4)). Briefly, the APA&Co project was conducted to observe the change in physical condition, physical activity, and motivation for physical activity in coronary artery disease patients at 1 year after following a cardiac rehabilitation program. This research project was managed by the hospital center of Cholet (France).

The repository has two branches, `master` and `pipeline`:

* The `master` branch contains the code and the data of the `{APACo}` package, that is needed to run the analytical pipeline of the project. This package is not intended to provide functions that could be reused in other projects. Some of the functions actually could be used for this purpose, but most of them were designed only to work with the data of the project. 
* The `pipeline` branch contains the code to run the analytical pipeline. Please visit this branch [here](https://github.com/pydemull/APACo/tree/pipeline) to get the information presenting the steps to be followed to run the pipeline.
