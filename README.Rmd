## Get an overview of the package
This package was build to perform, share, and reproduce the analytical pipeline implemented to get the results of the 'APA&Co' project ([ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04732923](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04732923?term=APA%26Co&rank=4)). Briefly, the 'APA&Co' project was conducted to observe the change in physical condition, physical activity, and motivation for physical activity in coronary artery disease patients at 1 year after following a cardiac rehabilitation program. This research project was managed by the hospital center of Cholet (France). The present package is not intended to provide functions that could be reused in other projects. Some of the functions actually could be used for this purpose, but most of them were designed only to work with the data of the project.


## Reproduce the analytical pipeline
The analytical pipeline implemented to the get the results of the project is based on packages that have been designed to make all analyses reproducible with R programming language: the {renv} package, and the {targets} package. {renv} will allow you to restore all the exact package dependencies that have been used to perform analyses and to get the final materials of the project. {target} will provide you the structure to automatically drive the analyses. Please follow the steps below if you want to reproduce the analyses of the project.

* Step 1: Install R and RStudio on your machine.
* Step 2: Download the zip file of the {APACo} package and unzip it on your machine.
* Step 3 : Open the project in RStudio by double-clicking on the `.Rproj` file of the unzipped folder.
* Step 4: Restore the package dependencies of the project with {renv} using the following command line in the Console:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

* Step 5: Run the analytical pipeline with {targets} using the following command line in the Console:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
targets::tar_make()
```

This last step will produce all the objects created during the analytical process. It also will generate the materials (a .html report with the main results, .tiff figures, and .html file-based supplementary materials) that are deemed to be used for a scientific publication. Some materials will take time to be built because they include several high resolution figures, so please be patient.

Once the analytical pipeline ended, you will can access any created object using `targets::tar_read(OBJECT_NAME)` in the Console to read it in the Console or in the viewer pane depending on the class of the object, or using `targets::tar_load(OBJECT_NAME)` in the Console to load the object in the global environment. You can load all the created objects in one go using `targets::tar_load_everything()` in the Console. All the figures and .html files generated during the run of the analytical pipeline will appear in a new `out/` folder placed at the root of the project.

## Verify the code
The main interest of running the analytical pipeline is to allow an exact reproduction of the analysis process. However, you will not see what are the computations actually performed behind the scene. To have more information about it, you can open the `_targets.R` file placed at the root of the project. This file essentially includes a list of `tar_target()` functions, with the name of the object created as first argument, and the operations performed to get that object as second argument. A quick way of looking at the code could be to copy the name of a function of interest and paste it in the Console. Another way, which will provide you a more confortable view of the code, is to go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/pydemull/APACo) of the {APACo} package. The files placed in the `R/` folder contain the code of each of the functions developped for the project.
