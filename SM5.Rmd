# Shift and difference asymmetry functions
```{r, fig.width=22, fig.height=16, fig.cap='Change in IPAQ-SF MET-min/week between 6 and 12 months (N = 77). On panel A, the errors bars over the points are the standard deviations around the means, while on panel D it is the percentile bootstrap 95% confidence interval around the median estimate. On panels E and F, the error bars are percentile bootstrap 95% confidence intervals non corrected for multiple comparisons. On panels B, C and D, the horizontal and/or vertical segments are the estimates of the deciles (panels B and C) or the quantiles (panel D, step of 0.05) of the distributions; the thickest segments are the median estimates. On panel B, the diagonal black line depicts the identity line. If any, significant results (based on adjusted p-values) in the shift (panel E) and difference asymmetry (panel F) functions are highlighted using thick red circles. A small pseudo-random movement has been added horizontally and vertically to the raw data displayed on panel B to minimize the presence of points fully overlapped. The estimates of the deciles of the marginal distributions (panels B, C and D), the quantiles of the individual differences (panel D), the decile differences (panel E) and the quantile sums (panel F) have been computed using the Harrell-Davis estimator.'}
