## Shift and difference asymmetry functions
```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=16, fig.cap='Change in 6-min walking test (6MWT) distance between 0 and 12 months (N = 75). On panels A and D, the error bars over the points are the standard deviations around the means. On panels E and F, the error bars are the percentile bootstrap 95% confidence intervals non corrected for multiple comparisons. On panel B, the black line depicts the identity line. If any, significant results (based on adjusted p-values) in the shift (panel E) and difference asymmetry (panel F) functions are highlighted using thick red circles. A small pseudo-random movement has been added horizontally and vertically to the raw data displayed on panel B to minimize the presence of points fully overlapped. The decile differences (panels C and E) and the quantile sums (panel F) have been computed using the Harrel-Davis estimator.'}
